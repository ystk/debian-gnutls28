.SH NAME
tpmtool \- GnuTLS TPM tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tpmtool
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.RB [ \-\fIflag\fP " [\fIvalue\fP]]... [" \-\-\fIopt\-name\fP "[[=| ]\fIvalue\fP]]..."
.PP
All arguments must be options.
.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Program that allows handling cryptographic data from the TPM chip.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-debug "=" \fInumber\fP
Enable debugging.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 9999
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Specifies the debug level.
.TP
.BR  \-\-infile "=\fIfile\fP"
Input file.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-outfile "=\fIstring\fP"
Output file.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-generate\-rsa
Generate an RSA private-public key pair.
.sp
Generates an RSA private-public key pair in the TPM chip. 
The key may be stored in filesystem and protected by a PIN, or stored (registered)
in the TPM chip flash.
.TP
.BR  \-\-register
Any generated key will be registered in the TPM.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
generate-rsa.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-signing
Any generated key will be a signing key.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
generate-rsa.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
legacy.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-legacy
Any generated key will be a legacy key.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
generate-rsa.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
signing.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-user
Any registered key will be a user key.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
register.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
system.
.sp
The generated key will be stored in a user specific persistent storage.
.TP
.BR  \-\-system
Any registred key will be a system key.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
register.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
user.
.sp
The generated key will be stored in system persistent storage.
.TP
.BR  \-\-pubkey "=\fIurl\fP"
Prints the public key of the provided key.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-list
Lists all stored keys in the TPM.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-delete "=\fIurl\fP"
Delete the key identified by the given URL (UUID)..
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-sec\-param "=\fIsecurity parameter\fP"
Specify the security level [low, legacy, medium, high, ultra]..
.sp
This is alternative to the bits option. Note however that the
values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given values may be rounded up.
.TP
.BR  \-\-bits "=\fInumber\fP"
Specify the number of bits for key generate.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-inder, " \fB\-\-no\-inder\fP"
Use the DER format for keys..
The \fIno\-inder\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
The input files will be assumed to be in the portable
DER format of TPM. The default format is a custom format used by various
TPM tools
.TP
.BR  \-\-outder, " \fB\-\-no\-outder\fP"
Use DER format for output keys.
The \fIno\-outder\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
The output will be in the TPM portable DER format.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[={\fIv|c|n\fP}]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH EXAMPLES
To generate a key that is to be stored in filesystem use:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ tpmtool \-\-generate\-rsa \-\-bits 2048 \-\-outfile tpmkey.pem
.in -4
.fi
.sp
To generate a key that is to be stored in TPM's flash use:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ tpmtool \-\-generate\-rsa \-\-bits 2048 \-\-register \-\-user
.in -4
.fi
.sp
To get the public key of a TPM key use:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ tpmtool \-\-pubkey tpmkey:uuid=58ad734b\-bde6\-45c7\-89d8\-756a55ad1891;storage=user \
          \-\-outfile pubkey.pem
.in -4
.fi
.sp
or if the key is stored in the filesystem:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ tpmtool \-\-pubkey tpmkey:file=tmpkey.pem \-\-outfile pubkey.pem
.in -4
.fi
.sp
To list all keys stored in TPM use:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ tpmtool \-\-list
.in -4
.fi
