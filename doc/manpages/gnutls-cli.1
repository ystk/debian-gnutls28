.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some other computer. 
It sets up a TLS connection and forwards data from the standard input to the secured socket and vice versa.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-debug "=" \fInumber\fP
Enable debugging.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.

.TP
.BR  \-\-tofu, " \fB\-\-no\-tofu\fP"
Enable trust on first use authentication.
The \fIno\-tofu\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
This option will, in addition to certificate authentication, perform authentication
based on previously seen public keys, a model similar to SSH authentication. Note that when tofu 
is specified (PKI) and DANE authentication will become advisory to assist the public key acceptance
process.
.TP
.BR  \-\-strict\-tofu, " \fB\-\-no\-strict\-tofu\fP"
Fail to connect if a known certificate has changed.
The \fIno\-strict\-tofu\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
This option will perform authentication as with option --tofu; however, while --tofu asks whether to trust a changed public key, this option will fail in case of public key changes.
.TP
.BR  \-\-dane, " \fB\-\-no\-dane\fP"
Enable DANE certificate verification (DNSSEC).
The \fIno\-dane\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
This option will, in addition to certificate authentication using 
the trusted CAs, verify the server certificates using on the DANE information
available via DNSSEC.

Use the local DNS server for DNSSEC resolving.
The \fIno\-local\-dns\fP form will disable the option.

This option will use the local DNS server for DNSSEC.
This is disabled by default due to many servers not allowing DNSSEC.
.TP
.BR  \-\-ca\-verification, " \fB\-\-no\-ca\-verification\fP"
Disable CA certificate verification.
The \fIno\-ca\-verification\fP form will disable the option.
This option is enabled by default.

.SH EXAMPLES
.br
\fBConnecting using PSK authentication\fP
.br
To connect to a server using PSK authentication, you need to enable the choice of PSK by using a cipher priority parameter such as in the example below. 
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ ./gnutls\-cli \-p 5556 localhost \-\-pskusername psk_identity \
    \-\-pskkey 88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344 \
    \-\-priority NORMAL:\-KX\-ALL:+ECDHE\-PSK:+DHE\-PSK:+PSK
Resolving 'localhost'...
Connecting to '127.0.0.1:5556'...
- PSK authentication.
- Version: TLS1.1
- Key Exchange: PSK
- Cipher: AES\-128\-CBC
- MAC: SHA1
- Compression: NULL
- Handshake was completed
- Simple Client Mode:
.in -4
.fi
By keeping the \-\-pskusername parameter and removing the \-\-pskkey parameter, it will query only for the password during the handshake. 
.sp
.br
\fBListing ciphersuites in a priority string\fP
.br
To list the ciphersuites in a priority string:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ ./gnutls\-cli \-\-priority SECURE192 \-l
Cipher suites for SECURE192
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA384         0xc0, 0x24	TLS1.2
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384         0xc0, 0x2e	TLS1.2
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384           0xc0, 0x30	TLS1.2
TLS_DHE_RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256             0x00, 0x6b	TLS1.2

\fBConnecting using a PKCS #11 token\fP
.br
To connect to a server using a certificate and a private key present in a PKCS #11 token you 
need to substitute the PKCS 11 URLs in the x509certfile and x509keyfile parameters.
.sp
Those can be found using "p11tool \-\-list\-tokens" and then listing all the objects in the
needed token, and using the appropriate.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ p11tool \-\-list\-tokens
.sp
Token 0:
URL: pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test
Label: Test
Manufacturer: EnterSafe
Model: PKCS15
Serial: 1234
.sp
$ p11tool \-\-login \-\-list\-certs "pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test"
.sp
Object 0:
URL: pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object\-type=cert
Type: X.509 Certificate
Label: client
ID: 2a:97:0d:58:d1:51:3c:23:07:ae:4e:0d:72:26:03:7d:99:06:02:6a
.sp
$ export MYCERT="pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object\-type=cert"
$ export MYKEY="pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object\-type=private"
.sp
$ gnutls\-cli www.example.com \-\-x509keyfile $MYKEY \-\-x509certfile MYCERT
.in -4
.fi
Notice that the private key only differs from the certificate in the object\-type.
