.SH EXAMPLES
To add a user 'psk_identity' in \fIpasswd.psk\fP for use with GnuTLS run:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ ./psktool \-u psk_identity \-p passwd.psk
Generating a random key for user 'psk_identity'
Key stored to passwd.psk
$ cat psks.txt
psk_identity:88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344
$
.in -4
.fi
.sp
This command will create \fIpasswd.psk\fP if it does not exist
and will add user 'psk_identity' (you will also be prompted for a password).
