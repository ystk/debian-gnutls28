.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-debug "=" \fInumber\fP

This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 9999
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Specifies the debug level.
.TP
.BR  \-V ", " -\-verbose
More verbose output.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-infile "=\fIfile\fP"
Input file.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-outfile "=\fIstring\fP"
Output file.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-load\-pubkey "=\fIstring\fP"
Loads a public key file.
.sp
This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL
.TP
.BR  \-\-load\-certificate "=\fIstring\fP"
Loads a certificate file.
.sp
This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL
.TP
.BR  \-\-dlv "=\fIstring\fP"
Sets a DLV file.
.sp
This sets a DLV file to be used for DNSSEC verification.
.TP
.BR  \-\-hash "=\fIstring\fP"
Hash algorithm to use for signing.
.sp
Available hash functions are SHA1, RMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512.
.TP
.BR  \-\-check "=\fIstring\fP"
Check a host's DANE TLSA entry.
.sp
Obtains the DANE TLSA entry from the given hostname and prints information. Note that the actual certificate of the host can be provided using --load-certificate, otherwise danetool will connect to the server to obtain it. The exit code on verification success will be zero.
.TP
.BR  \-\-check\-ee
Check only the end-entity's certificate.
.sp
Checks the end-entity's certificate only. Trust anchors or CAs are not considered.
.TP
.BR  \-\-check\-ca
Check only the CA's certificate.
.sp
Checks the trust anchor's and CA's certificate only. End-entities are not considered.
.TP
.BR  \-\-tlsa\-rr
Print the DANE RR data on a certificate or public key.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
host.
.sp
This command prints the DANE RR data needed to enable DANE on a DNS server.
.TP
.BR  \-\-host "=\fIhostname\fP"
Specify the hostname to be used in the DANE RR.
.sp
This command sets the hostname for the DANE RR.
.TP
.BR  \-\-proto "=\fIprotocol\fP"
The protocol set for DANE data (tcp, udp etc.).
.sp
This command specifies the protocol for the service set in the DANE data.
.TP
.BR  \-\-port "=\fInumber\fP"
Specify the port number for the DANE data.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-app\-proto "=\fIstring\fP"
The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's certificate (https, smtp, imap).
.sp
When the server's certificate isn't provided danetool will connect to the server to obtain the certificate. In that case it is required to known the protocol to talk with the server prior to initiating the TLS handshake.
.TP
.BR  \-\-ca
Whether the provided certificate or public key is a Certificate Authority.
.sp
Marks the DANE RR as a CA certificate if specified.
.TP
.BR  \-\-x509
Use the hash of the X.509 certificate, rather than the public key.
.sp
This option forces the generated record to contain the hash of the full X.509 certificate. By default only the hash of the public key is used.
.TP
.BR  \-\-local
This is an alias for the \fI--domain\fR option.
.TP
.BR  \-\-domain, " \fB\-\-no\-domain\fP"
The provided certificate or public key is issued by the local domain.
The \fIno\-domain\fP form will disable the option.
This option is enabled by default.
.sp
DANE distinguishes certificates and public keys offered via the DNSSEC to trusted and local entities. This flag indicates that this is a domain-issued certificate, meaning that there could be no CA involved.
.TP
.BR  \-\-local\-dns, " \fB\-\-no\-local\-dns\fP"
Use the local DNS server for DNSSEC resolving.
The \fIno\-local\-dns\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
This option will use the local DNS server for DNSSEC.
This is disabled by default due to many servers not allowing DNSSEC.
.TP
.BR  \-\-insecure
Do not verify any DNSSEC signature.
.sp
Ignores any DNSSEC signature verification results.
.TP
.BR  \-\-inder, " \fB\-\-no\-inder\fP"
Use DER format for input certificates and private keys.
The \fIno\-inder\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
The input files will be assumed to be in DER or RAW format. 
Unlike options that in PEM input would allow multiple input data (e.g. multiple 
certificates), when reading in DER format a single data structure is read.
.TP
.BR  \-\-inraw
This is an alias for the \fI--inder\fR option.
.TP
.BR  \-\-print\-raw, " \fB\-\-no\-print\-raw\fP"
Print the received DANE data in raw format.
The \fIno\-print\-raw\fP form will disable the option.
.sp
This option will print the received DANE data.
.TP
.BR  \-\-quiet
Suppress several informational messages.
.sp
In that case on the exit code can be used as an indication of verification success
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[={\fIv|c|n\fP}]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH EXAMPLES
.br
\fBDANE TLSA RR generation\fP
.br
.sp
To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a certificate (or public key) 
that was issued localy and may or may not be signed by a CA use the following command.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ danetool \-\-tlsa\-rr \-\-host www.example.com \-\-load\-certificate cert.pem
.in -4
.fi
.sp
To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a CA signed certificate, which will
be marked as such use the following command.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ danetool \-\-tlsa\-rr \-\-host www.example.com \-\-load\-certificate cert.pem \
  \-\-no\-domain
.in -4
.fi
.sp
The former is useful to add in your DNS entry even if your certificate is signed 
by a CA. That way even users who do not trust your CA will be able to verify your
certificate using DANE.
.sp
In order to create a record for the CA signer of your certificate use the following.
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ danetool \-\-tlsa\-rr \-\-host www.example.com \-\-load\-certificate cert.pem \
  \-\-ca \-\-no\-domain
.in -4
.fi
.sp
To read a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ danetool \-\-check www.example.com \-\-proto tcp \-\-port 443
.in -4
.fi
.sp
To verify a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
.br
.in +4
.nf
$ danetool \-\-check www.example.com \-\-proto tcp \-\-port 443 \-\-load\-certificate chain.pem
.in -4
.fi
.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"

.TP
.BR 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.TP
.BR 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
