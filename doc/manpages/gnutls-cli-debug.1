.SH "DESCRIPTION"
TLS debug client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to 
a server and queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging 
GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capabilities.
It connects to a TLS server, performs tests and print the server's 
capabilities. If called with the `-v' parameter more checks will be performed.
Can be used to check for servers with special needs or bugs.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-debug "=" \fInumber\fP
Enable debugging.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 9999
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Specifies the debug level.
.TP
.BR  \-V ", " -\-verbose
More verbose output.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-p " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-port "=" \fInumber\fP
The port to connect to.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 65536
.fi
.in -4
.sp
.TP
.BR  \-\-app\-proto "=\fIstring\fP"
The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's certificate (https, smtp, imap).
.sp
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[={\fIv|c|n\fP}]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
